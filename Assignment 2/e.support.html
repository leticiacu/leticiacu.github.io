Support Class Support

Support Legends are those with abilities for protecting, reviving, or resupplying squadmates. Their class perk allows them to open the secret compartment in Extended Supply Bins, which always contains regen items or survival items. They also give their team the ability to use Replicators to craft respawn banner cards for their eliminated squadmates.
